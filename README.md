# Urban-Population-Trends-Analysis-Project

#### Introduction

This project focuses on leveraging Python-based geospatial visualization tools to examine and analyze urban population trends worldwide. It is divided into two primary sections:

1. **Task 1.1: Choropleth Maps using Geopandas**
2. **Task 1.2: Advanced Geospatial Visualizations**

#### Task 1: Introduction

The aim is to utilize Python-based geospatial visualization tools to examine and analyze urban population trends worldwide. This task is divided into the following parts:

##### Task 1.1: Choropleth Maps using Geopandas

This section uses Geopandas, a powerful Python library that extends the functionality of pandas to include spatial operations on geometric types, to create choropleth maps. Choropleth maps display statistical variables by shading areas in proportion to the measurement, such as population density or per-capita income.

For this task, the urban population data from the World Bank is used to create choropleth maps for the years 2001 and 2021. This visualization provides a comprehensive view of the shifts in urban population over two decades. The key steps involved are:

1. **Importing Data**
2. **Cleaning Data**
3. **Performing Geospatial Operations**
4. **Creating Visualizations**

##### Code Example

The following libraries are essential for this task:

```python
import geopandas as gpd  # Geospatial data analysis
import pandas as pd  # Data analysis tools
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Static plots
import plotly.express as px  # Interactive plots
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots  # Subplots in Plotly
```

Load the urban population dataset:

```python
urban_population_df = pd.read_csv("API_SP.URB.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_12209.csv", skiprows=4)
```

Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure:

```python
urban_population_df.head()
```

Using `skiprows` helps to bypass the initial rows that are not part of the main data table. Examining the dataset's initial rows is crucial for understanding its format.

#### Task 1.2: Advanced Geospatial Visualizations

In this section, advanced geospatial visualization techniques are employed to gain deeper insights into the urban population trends. This involves interactive visualizations and more complex geospatial operations.

### Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- geopandas
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install geopandas pandas matplotlib plotly
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure the necessary datasets are in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and generate visualizations.

### Conclusion

This project provides a detailed analysis of urban population trends using geospatial visualization techniques. By following the steps outlined, you can replicate the visualizations and gain insights into how urban populations have shifted over the years.
